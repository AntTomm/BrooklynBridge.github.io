<H1>Pier 5 @ Brooklyn Bridge: A Waterfront Oasis</H1>
Located alongside the East River in Brooklyn stands a somewhat gatekept, beloved waterfront area - Pier 5 at Brooklyn Bridge Park. 
Right away from the photographs, you may be able to tell that it was a seaport, but throughout time, it was transformed into this
amazing multi-purpose recreational space.
