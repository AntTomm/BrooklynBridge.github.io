<H1>Pier 5 @ Brooklyn Bridge: A Waterfront Oasis</H1>
Located alongside the East River in Brooklyn stands a somewhat gatekept, beloved waterfront area - Pier 5 at Brooklyn Bridge Park. 
Right away from the photographs, you may be able to tell that it was a seaport, but throughout time, it was transformed into this
amazing multi-purpose recreational space. I say "gatekept" because in order to get here, (or, at least how I got here), you had to walk through
an extremely nice and obviously gentrified part of Brooklyn, with upkept architecture, beautiful brownstones, brick flooring, and construction in the surrounding area, way past 
the Court Street train station. As soon as you approach the Pier, you can immediately notice a bright, welcoming sign that introduces the park. 
It's not only a directional marker, but displays its use as a public green space with sutainability and community engagement!

<H1>Arriving @ the Park</H1>
 Right past that sign on the right, there is a walkway that you can use to explore the length of the East River shoreline. The photo
 displays a path with greenery along both sides. I can imagine it is probably a popular commodity when the weather is warmer
 (I didn't exactly go on the warmest day, but it wasn't that cold either). Having walked through it, you can get pretty close to the Shoreline.
 Along the shoreline, there are also rocks lining the edge, and as long as you aren't being clumsy, you can sit on the rocks.
