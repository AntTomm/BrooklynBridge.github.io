# Pier 5 @ Brooklyn Bridge: A Waterfront Oasis
![welcomeSign](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae1107b-a9d2-46d8-ada5-49509504c7cc) 
Located alongside the East River in Brooklyn stands a somewhat gatekept, beloved waterfront area - Pier 5 at Brooklyn Bridge Park. 
Right away from the photographs, you may be able to tell that it was a seaport, but throughout time, it was transformed into this
amazing multi-purpose recreational space. I say "gatekept" because in order to get here, (or, at least how I got here), you had to walk through
an extremely nice and obviously gentrified part of Brooklyn, with upkept architecture, beautiful brownstones, brick flooring, and construction in the surrounding area, way past 
the Court Street train station. As soon as you approach the Pier, you can immediately notice a bright, welcoming sign that introduces the park. 
It's not only a directional marker, but displays its use as a public green space with sutainability and community engagement!

# Arriving @ the Park
![trail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c91162d-a361-4278-84b8-0a4792683c4e)
 Right past that sign on the right, there is a walkway that you can use to explore the length of the East River shoreline. The photo
 displays a path with greenery along both sides. I can imagine it is probably a popular commodity when the weather is warmer
 (I didn't exactly go on the warmest day, but it wasn't that cold either). Having walked through it, you can get pretty close to the shoreline.
 Along the shoreline, there are also rocks lining the edge, and as long as you aren't being clumsy, you can sit on the rocks. 

# A City View
![cityView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4048598-552c-4336-96f4-2f6be16f20bc)
 As I just stated, you may see rocks lined alongside the edge. Yes, it is to prevent citizens from falling over into the shoreline, but you 
 can also sit on them. You are also greeted with a sight that feels like it's straight out of a postcard: the entire Manhattan skyline standing tall
 on the opposite shore. Depending on the weather (I got lucky that day, obviously), the skyscrapers may glint in the sunshine, or on a crisp morning, may be softly
 covered in mist. Regardless, this is not an angle that you can find anywhere. It makes you stop and think how just remarkable it is to be living in such a 
 beautiful city. Not only that, but being the "City that Never Sleeps", it's nice to find such tranquility and open space in the heart of the City. 

# Emerging Green Spaces

 As I exited the walking path (there are numerous ways to exit), I snapped a picture of the trees, and saw a person jogging, a person walking their dog,
 In the background, someone is relaxing under the umbrella. This is all provided by the park, as it's a public space. As you can see from the ground, there are
 painted lines showcasing the joggers where they can follow, making it easy for people to come and go as they please. The faint hum of the city traffic contrasts
 with the gentle breeze flowing off the bay, reminding you that you're in a space that merges the urban with the natural.

# Soon To Come...
 I took this photo to show that Pier 5 is continuing to advance with new playground equipment for those who still want something to do, but don't want to sit around
 or play soccer. Even the younger generations can be active here. It also depicts how much the city cares for such a nice part of Brooklyn, as they are creating
 updated play equipment strictly for the children. They are also adding "shade canopies" to improve sun protection and keep everyone safe. 
 
 # Watch the World go By

 So, yes, one of the delights of Pier 5 is the number of seating options availble to its visitors. You'll notice more formal benches as well as the nicely, coincidentally placed
 boulders and wooden ledges that double as seats. As I walked through the numerous picnic tables, I also came across a family sitting down playing music and enjoying lunch (not pictured for obvious reasons).
 People come here to rest, jog, share a meal, or just to take a moment to enjoy the view. The people sitting here also love watching the world around them, from the Manhattan Skyline to the...

 # SOCCER!!
![soccerField](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce678c89-ba96-470a-b400-3bcdbc5946f5)
 The soccer field! Yes, one of the most popular portions of Pier 5 is the humungous soccer field places right next to the bay, and overlooking the Lower Manhattan Skyline.
 I have personally been here a few nights with my friends during sundown, and there are also lights that go on at night so you can continue playing. The sprawling green turf field has
 crisp white boundary lines, and if you can't tell from the scale of this photograph already, there are tons of open soccer fields for multiple gatherings of people to play on. 

 # Taking a Break
![iceCream](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a0477c-a747-4d14-b71a-c962d8ff565c)
 After soaking in the sun, going on a mile-long jog, or playing soccer with your friends on a hot spring or summer day, it'd be nice to kick back and enjoy a sweet treat.
 Oddfellows Ice Cream Co. is located directly next to the soccer field, a plethora of seated areas with shade, and other benches in the area. At the time I went, it was closed
 (probably due to the weather, I dropped by on Friday the 28th around 3:30 PM). While the prices aren't the prettiest, being a single scoop for $6.51, and topping are $1.50 extra,
 if you have the money to buy it, it makes the experience all the better, espeically combined with the weather around the warmer months. 

 # Learning Through Signage
![signage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15920bac-9262-41cf-b89c-b823e7fbd7e7)
 Not only is this park a place to play, but a place to learn. This signage features one of the park's many interpretive signs. It describes everything from where to go for
 the train stations, local bars and pizza places, St. Ann's Warehouse, which is a local performing arts institution, etc. These signs are prompted all over the area, and
 show just how much the pier has to offer.

 # Sustainability & Future Growth
![pier5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46d83d5e-310a-4a7a-905e-894a9ec06815)
 One of the main reasons Pier 5 has become such a beloved community space is because of the family-friendly atmosphere. Surely if I went on a nicer day, it would be much
 more lively, but its not unusual at all to see strollers next to picnic plankets, or children running freely throughout the fields. The pathways are perfect for bikes, scooters, skateboards,
 joggers, dog joggers, and so much more. The open sightlines also make it easy for parents to keep track of their children. Brooklyn Bridge Park as a whole has designated playgrounds at 
 other piers as well, like Pier 6, which has slides, swings, and even water features. Though, Pier 5's open field caters more towards organized sports or pick-up games, but the citizens 
 can consider the entire park to be their playground. The pier overall stands as a testamnet to New York City's ability to innovate and reimagine it's urban landscapes. What was once a largely inaccessible 
 stretch of piers is now a calming promenade and a welcoming community space that draws in a multitude of visitors throughout the year. Whether you're walking alongside the waterfront, getting ice cream,
 or just taking in the moment of silence before entering the Big Apple, Pier 5 is just one of the few examples of New York's dynamic energy. It's a hidden gem in Brooklyn that reminds us to slow down and reconnect.
